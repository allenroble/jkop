Jkop - A universal software development framework
=================================================

Jkop is a multi-platform, multi-language application development framework and API,
intended to support the development of different kinds of applications on multiple
programming languages and operating systems. Originally developed in Sling, the code
is translated to different programming languages to support the different platforms.
Currently Jkop fully supports development in Sling, Java, C#, Objective-C and JavaScript,
and is actively tested on Android, iOS, macOS / Mac OS X, Windows, Linux and the web.

Jkop is fully written in the [Sling Programming Language](http://eqdn.tech/sling),
